Researchers looked at overdose data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2015 and 2019 to calculate the total number of years of life lost for 10- to 19-year-olds who died during that time. If the data is expanded to include people up to 24 years of age, unintentional drug overdoses resulted in the loss of 1.25 million years of life.  The number of young people dying from an unintentional overdose has steadily increased in recent years, as it has for the general population, according to data from the National Institutes of Health. Earlier studies have shown that mental health issues, unstable housing and other factors may be to blame for many of these unintentional drug overdoses. \\\"This is just completely unacceptable from a public health standpoint, because every one of these deaths is preventable,\\\" said study co-author Dr. Orman T. Hall, a psychiatry specialist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Hall believes the research also shows that public health interventions that are aimed at adults probably don't work as well for all ages. \\\"A lot of our public health interventions are geared towards adults. And we know that the types of messaging and, really, the points of contact for adolescents and young people are different from adults,\\\" Hall said. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended universal screening for substance use with adolescent patients. If the adolescent has a positive screen for drugs, the association encourages pediatricians to find out whether substance use is interfering with the teen's daily activities or putting their safety at risk. Doctors are urged to talk to the teen about the dangers of drugs and the effects on the brain, as well as talk to their parents, and then refer them for treatment.  Often, though, that's where the system falls short, according to Dr. Paula Riggs, a professor and director of the Division of Addiction Science, Prevention and Treatment in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \\\"Less than 10% of kids go to treatment with the standard screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment model that we're using,\\\" said Riggs, who wasn't involved in the new study. \\\"They do a great job screening, but the referral to treatment part is not working. It's broken.\\\" Riggs says she's been thinking a lot about how to improve the system to get more kids into treatment so they don't overdose. As a clinician, as well as a researcher, she's seen an increasing number of children who need help for problems with opioids and fentanyl. \\\"There are systems barriers and silos, and the adultified models that we have are not so much appropriate and developmentally adapted\\\" for teens, Riggs said. For example, she recently got a call from a 16-year-old who was in the emergency room for fentanyl withdrawal.  \\\"He said, 'I don't want to leave. I was here two weeks ago with a fentanyl withdrawal, and they discharged me with a list of numbers to detox programs. I called them all, but they're all for adults. They won't take me.' He was afraid he would relapse -- or worse -- without the help,\\\" Riggs said. There are some effective evidence-based treatments for adolescents, studies show. A type of therapy called motivational enhancement can work. It helps people strengthen their motivation to quit using, build a plan for change and develop coping strategies for high-risk stuations. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also be helpful. Something as simple as a warmer handoff between the doctor and a treatment program works, Riggs says: Instead of handing a teen a list of numbers to call, the doctor will ask if they can share the teen's information with her, and she will reach out to the adolescent to have a brief confidential consultation. \\\"Giving a kid a list of numbers to call, you won't get them into treatment that way,\\\" Riggs said. She's getting about 40% to 40% of young patients to then engage in substance use treatment. And she's training more people on this method, but it takes time.  More doctors also need to be trained to work with patients with substance use problems, Riggs said. Studies show that even brief training sessions can boost a pediatrician's ability to help young patients. Riggs also said more people need to be trained and licensed to prescribe buprenorphine or other medication-assisted treatments. \\\"We're still in the middle of a raging and rising opioid epidemic in this country, and kids younger and younger are getting into it, and the fentanyl is just -- well, it's literally killing them,\\\" Riggs said. \\\"We need to get more kids into treatment.\\\"\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4791,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BAIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_pmv\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/physical-activity-monitors-increase-study-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"One easy way to get moving again, according to science\",\n                    \"article\": \" Monitoring exercise increased that activity among the more than 16,000 participants in a study published last week. Researchers looked at data from 121 randomized control trials and 141 study comparisons to find what impact exercise monitors -- like those found on phone apps and Fitbits -- had on everyday physical activity, moderate and vigorous physical activity, and sedentary time, according to the study. Using fitness apps increased everyday physical activity by an equivalent of 1,235 steps a day, and moderate and vigorous physical activity by 48.5 minutes a week, research showed. The impact on sedentary time was insignificant, according to the study. \\\"People who use activity monitors and wearables are more active than people that do not,\\\" said Rasmus Tolstrup Larsen, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen's department of public health. \\\"These effects are highly relevant in terms of health and risk of diseases, especially among people who are only moderately active or do not meet current guidelines for physical activity,\\\" he said via email. Larsen is also a management consultant at IQVIA Healthcare. The efficacy of fitness monitors has been a commonly investigated question since they hit the market, but this study takes the largest comprehensive look to date, Larsen said. And it comes as many people are looking to get moving again during a pandemic that has created conditions encouraging more sedentary behavior. \\\"In a post-covid time, the need for focus on behavioural change in relation to physical activity and inactivity is as urgent as ever before,\\\" Larsen said via email. \\\"Modern physical activity monitors (wearables, smart watches or fitness-trackers) have the potential to be used as facilitators for behavioural change, providing direct feedback on activity to the user.\\\" While the study is \\\"careful and useful,\\\" it does raise further questions, said Dr. David Asch, a professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine and Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Center for Health Care Innovation. He said he would have liked to see an analysis as well of how the different trials the study examined used rewards and incentives.  How to use them better If you are hoping 2022 will be a more active year than those that came before, Larsen recommended looking into a monitoring device -- or using the ones available on your smartphone. \\\"The devices are cheap, simple, and innovative. Now we can safely say that they are effectively motivating people for more activity in a safe way,\\\" Larsen added. But an activity monitor alone may not be your best bet for success, said Dr. Mitesh Patel, associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and vice president for clinical transformation at Ascension, a private health care system. \\\"Changing behavior is always hard,\\\" said Patel, who was not involved in the study. \\\"Using an activity monitor, like the ones available within smartphones and other devices, can be an important part of efforts to increase physical activity.\\\" Other research in the field suggests that they work even better when combined with programs aimed at changing behavior, like adding elements that make the behavior more like a game or leveraging financial or social incentives, Patel said. What these tracking apps do add is a level of personal accountability, said Dana Santas, a CNN fitness contributor and mind-body coach for professional athletes. It doesn't even have to be electronic, she added. Using a notebook or any physical reminder tends to embody our conscience. And a little competition with yourself never hurts, Santas said. \\\"When my Apple Watch sends me a message saying, 'you can still make it happen,' it motivates me to make whatever happen that my watch is telling me I haven't done yet, like reaching 10,000 steps or spending more time standing,\\\" Santas said. Making goals, adding incentives and adding in some accountability with a physical activity tracker may be what it takes to get you moving again, the experts agreed.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4070,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BQIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_pnE\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-approval/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine receives full FDA approval\",\n                    \"article\": \" The vaccine, named Spikevax, is now approved for use in people ages 18 and older.

The Pfizer vaccine is also authorized for use in individuals ages 5 to 15. Moderna said the FDA based its decision to give full approval on scientific evidence shared by Moderna in its submission package to the agency, which included six month follow up data from a Phase 3 clinical trial study as well as FDA-required manufacturing and facilities data. \\\"This is a momentous milestone in Moderna's history as it is our first product to achieve licensure in the U.S.,\\\" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel  said in the release. \\\"The full licensure of Spikevax in the U.S. now joins that in Canada, Japan, the European Union, the UK, Israel, and other countries, where the adolescent indication is also approved.

We are humbled by the role that Spikevax is playing to help end this pandemic.\\\" Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner, called the approval a \\\"significant step\\\" in the fight against Covid-19. \\\"The public can be assured that Spikevax meets the FDA's high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality required of any vaccine approved for use in the United States,\\\" Woodcock said in a statement. \\\"While hundreds of millions of doses of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine have been administered to individuals under emergency use authorization, we understand that for some individuals, FDA approval of this vaccine may instill additional confidence in making the decision to get vaccinated.\\\" The two-dose vaccine has been available in the US under FDA emergency use authorization since December 18, 2020. Since then, more than 204 million doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US, accounting for about 38% of all doses administered, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 75 million people have completed their initial series with the Moderna vaccine, and about 38.5 million people have gotten a Moderna booster shot. Makers of Covid-19 vaccines originally applied for emergency use authorizations because the authorization process takes less time than what's required for full approval. Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency. When the health emergency is over, \\\"then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,\\\" according to the FDA. A booster dose of the vaccine at a 50mg dose is currently available under EUA for those 18 years and older. A third 100mg dose of the vaccine is authorized for use in immunocompromised adults.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 3098,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BgIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5kY\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/moderna-mrna-hiv-vaccine/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"First patients vaccinated in clinical trial of HIV experimental vaccine that uses Moderna's mRNA technology\",\n                    \"article\": \" The trial, titled IAVI G002, is being conducted in partnership with IAVI, a nonprofit scientific research organization. It is testing a vaccine that delivers HIV-specific antigens to the body with the goal of inducing an immune response. These antigens were initially developed by researchers at IAVI and Scripps Research, led by Dr. William Schief. In a \\\"proof-of-concept\\\" trial last year, the research team found the HIV antigens produced the desired immune response in 97% of participants. The current trial builds on the previous one by testing the primary version of the vaccine and also a booster version, and by employing Moderna's mRNA technology, which was previously used to create a successful Covid-19 vaccine. \\\"We are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna's mRNA platform. The search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine,\\\" Mark Feinberg, IAVI's president and CEO, said in a news release from Moderna.  The new trial, funded in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will follow 56 HIV-negative adult participants, with the goal of studying both the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Forty-eight of the volunteers will receive at least one dose of the primary vaccine, 32 of which will also receive the booster. The remaining eight will receive the booster vaccine alone. The trial includes participants from four locations: George Washington University School of Medicine, Hope Clinic of Emory Vaccine Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 1752,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BwIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5kr\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/easing-covid-restrictions-pandemic-end-explainer/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"This map is the key to when US might start easing Covid-19 restrictions\",\n                    \"article\": \" But others warn not to relax such measures too soon. Denmark has decided to lift all Covid-19 restrictions within the country, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced Wednesday evening, adding that Covid-19 \\\"should no longer be categorized as a socially critical sickness.\\\" \\\"Denmark will be completely open from 1 February,\\\" Frederiksen said. \\\"Tonight we can start lowering our shoulders and find our smiles again. \\\"The pandemic is still here, but with what we know now, we dare to believe that we are through the critical phase,\\\" Frederiksen added, highlighting the success of Denmark's vaccination program and booster shots. In the United Kingdom, people in England no longer have to show their Covid-19 vaccination passes to get into nightclubs and other large venues. Masks aren't required in any public places, although they remain recommended on public transport. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also easing their restrictions. But in the United States, \\\"we know there is still much to be done to stop the spread of COVID-19 and end the pandemic. We are still seeing far too many new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths,\\\" Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote in an email to CNN on Friday. The US daily average of cases is near 500,000, with more than 1,000 deaths, according to the CDC, which encourages everyone to get vaccinated and boosted if they're eligible. \\\"As we look forward to the spring, it's important to continue practicing prevention measures that we know work -- vaccinating, wearing a mask in public, indoor settings, staying home when you are sick, and washing your hands frequently,\\\" Nordlund wrote. Many US counties and cities rely on coronavirus transmission rates to determine when or if to ease restrictions and recommendations -- and nearly every single county is still experiencing high levels of spread. Community transmission is still key metric In the United States, most Covid-19 orders happen at the local level. And the CDC's data on coronavirus transmission by county is used as a key metric in decision-making around public health policies and when certain restrictions should be implemented or lifted, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday. The CDC tracks and measures the spread of the virus by county and presents its findings on a map using a four-tiered, color-coded system that shades in counties with \\\"high\\\" levels of transmission as red, those with \\\"substantial\\\" levels as orange, \\\"moderate\\\" levels as yellow and \\\"low\\\" levels as blue. \\\"This is really important,\\\" Freeman said of the data. \\\"It's based on new cases per 100,000 persons in the past seven days. Low is less than 10. Moderate is another range, substantial another and high is another,\\\" she said. \\\"And then a secondary indicator is percentage of positive (nucleic acid amplification) tests during the past seven days.\\\" The CDC defines low transmission of the coronavirus as a community having fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week and less than 5% test positivity during the past week. High transmission is at least 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week, and 10% or greater percentage of positive tests. As of Monday, nearly all counties are in the red, with high levels of transmission. Only four are identified as having low levels: Kalawao County, Hawaii; King County, Texas; Arthur County, Nebraska; and Terrell County, Texas. Glasscock County, Texas, is identified as having substantial transmission. \\\"The whole country is still red,\\\" Freeman said. \\\"So we haven't yet overcome this latest surge.\\\"  In Columbus, Ohio, the recommendation for the city's mask order is \\\"that we need to be in CDC's yellow category for moderate community transmission for four consecutive weeks\\\" before the order can be lifted, spokesperson Kelli Newman wrote to CNN in an email Friday. In North Carolina's Mecklenburg County, there is an indoor mask mandate in place that will automatically lift once the percent positivity rate for the county falls below 5% for seven consecutive days, Raynard Washington, the county's public health director, told CNN on Friday. \\\"Within that mandate, there's actually a stipulation that's tied to community transmission, at which once the community reaches a certain level of transmission, as measured by percent positivity, the mask mandate itself will automatically be rescinded,\\\" Washington said. He added that right now, the county is \\\"a bit away\\\" from reaching that low level. In San Francisco, city officials announced Thursday that even though Covid-19 cases are \\\"still high,\\\" they are \\\"dropping rapidly\\\" and beginning Tuesday, city office workers, gym members and some other groups of people may remove their masks indoors if they are \\\"up to date\\\" on their vaccinations. In Colorado, the state Department of Public Health and Environment on Friday removed the requirement that people must show proof of vaccination to attend unseated, public indoor events of more than 500 attendees in Arapahoe, Adams, Boulder, and Jefferson counties — as well as the City and County of Denver, and the City and County of Broomfield. Health officials in Colorado have told reporters that the statewide percent positivity remains high, but shows \\\"encouraging\\\" decreases. There is no definitive, blanket guidance from the CDC on when communities should lift certain Covid-19 policies and return to some version of normal. But NACCHO plans to hold brainstorming and listening sessions this spring with local and federal public health officers to discuss what the end of the pandemic might look like -- and how to determine when we've reached the end. \\\"NACCHO is having meetings coming up in the spring where we're really actively focused on these discussions, but we're hoping before then, we'll have a little bit more direction and guidance to go on,\\\" Freeman said, adding that the first meeting is scheduled for April. She expects representatives from the CDC, Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in attendance.  It is going to be a \\\"real challenge\\\" to determine a clear benchmark for when Covid-19 health measures should lift in the United States, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday. \\\"Right now, you look at a lot of federal health guidance and it says that these measures should be lifted when there's low prevalence,\\\" Gottlieb told CBS's Margaret Brennan on Face The Nation. \\\"That was the old measure. In the age of Omicron, with a much more contagious variant and with the fact that the population has a lot of immunity, so we're less susceptible overall, we may need to rethink that,\\\" Gottlieb said Sunday. \\\"We may need to decide that once we get to 20 cases per 100,000 per day that may be the point at which we start to withdraw these things,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm not so sure we're going to get to 10 anytime soon. Right now, Washington DC is at 15. New York's at 75. With this new Omicron strain that's circling we may stall out around 20 -- and that may be the point where we have to consider withdrawing a lot of these measures.\\\" 'We're in a better place now' As the United States marks two years since the first laboratory-confirmed case of Covid-19, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said last week he's feeling positive about the direction the nation is headed. \\\"I am more optimistic about the pandemic today than I have been since it was declared a pandemic nearly two years ago,\\\" Frieden, currently the CEO and president of a global health initiative called Resolve to Save Lives, told CNN on Wednesday. Frieden added that the \\\"flash flood\\\" of cases stemming from a surge of the Omicron variant should soon slow, largely as a result of effective vaccines. \\\"We don't know if there will be another wave, but we do know that we've got much stronger defenses than we've ever had,\\\" Frieden said. \\\"We're in much better shape than we've ever been. But we do need to hang on for just a few more weeks, until the Omicron flood recedes, so we don't overwhelm the hospitals, which are really stressed out.\\\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has said he shares Frieden's optimism that the nation is in better shape, but he urges Americans to remain vigilant against Covid-19. \\\"I certainly share the optimism that we're in a better place now, and we will be in a better place in a few weeks, but I don't think that means that we should take our foot off the accelerator,\\\" Murthy told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday, though he added that we shouldn't underestimate the coronavirus. \\\"What gives me more optimism and hope, Jake, is the fact that we not only have abundantly available vaccines -- we not only see that they're working well to protect people against hospitalization and death -- but we have more therapeutics,\\\" Murthy said. \\\"These together, along with a targeted use of tests and masks, this is what I believe is going to help us get through future waves, as well.\\\"\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 9153,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CAIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5lE\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/health/exercise-good-for-sexual-health-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Why exercise is also good for your sexual health\",\n                    \"article\": \" Forty-three percent of women and 31% of men have some form of sexual dysfunction, with obesity and a lack of exercise often being factors, according to the National Institutes of Health. A study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine found men with either a high waist circumference or elevated BMI were 50% more likely to have erectile dysfunction, while approximately half of obese women reported problems with sexual activity, desire and performance, at least some of the time, in a study published in Obesity.   Women who exercised up to six hours per week, in contrast, showed lower sexual distress and resistance in their clitoral arteries compared to women who did not exercise, according to a 2021 study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. The exercisers also showed significantly higher levels of desire, arousal, lubrication and orgasm. \\\"This is truly a medical issue we should be dealing with as part of someone's overall health and well-being,\\\" said Dr. Karyn Eilber, a urologist at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a sexual wellness expert. \\\"But there's still a stigma around the topic.\\\"   There shouldn't be, said Eilber and other experts. Sex is a critical part of being human, and its significance is not just to procreate. Quality sexual activity has a major impact on your mental and emotional health, your quality of life and the strength of your intimate relationships. A series of studies backs this up, indicating sex and affectionate touch are critical for multiple aspects of well-being, such as feeling understood, cared for and accepted.    Here's what else happens to your body and mind when you exercise regularly. Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. Your circulation gets a boost All aerobic exercise increases your circulation, or blood flow, and helps ensure a healthy circulatory system. And a strong, smooth blood flow is key for arousal. In men, it aids in erections, and in women, it's instrumental in vaginal lubrication and clitoral sensation. Your endurance increases When you're working out regularly, you develop more endurance. That's important for your sexual health, because having sex is in itself a workout. The Mayo Clinic compares a bout of sexual intercourse to climbing two or three flights of stairs. And a study by the National Institutes of Health says a half-hour of sexual activity can burn 125 calories for men and nearly 100 for women, similar to walking at a 3 mile-per-hour pace.    You become more confidant Once you establish a routine exercise regimen, you feel fitter and leaner. This, in turn, improves self-esteem. \\\"Nothing is sexier than self-confidence,\\\" Eilber said. Indeed, a 2019 study published in the Journal of Personality found women had more romantic interest in men with higher social confidence, whether that confidence was innate or trained.   Your stress levels decrease Being stressed, anxious or depressed can dampen your libido. Depression in particular is often related to problems with sexual functioning, and the more severe the depression, the worse the problems, according to a 2018 study published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry. The study found this is especially true when it comes to sexual desire and satisfaction. Luckily, exercise is great at combating stress, anxiety and depression, which can translate into a revived sex drive. Antidepressants are also notorious for negatively affecting your libido, Eilber said, so if exercising can help you lower your dosage or scrap them altogether, all the better. Your overall health improves Adopt a regular exercise program, and your general health will improve. Working out may even help you stave off serious conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, which sometimes require medications that inhibit arousal. These two medical conditions also can damage the tiny arteries in the penis, resulting in erectile dysfunction. In fact, erectile dysfunction is often one of the first noticeable side effects of high blood pressure and diabetes.   How much exercise is necessary to improve your sexual health? It all depends on the person, so it's best to check with your physician. Experts say even short periods of exercise, such as regular brisk walks, can improve your sexual well-being. You do have to be careful not to overdo it, though. If you still aren't convinced it's time to grab your sneakers and start moving, consider this warning from Eilber. \\\"There is something to that phrase, 'Use it or lose it,'\\\" she said. \\\"Your pelvic organs are like any other body part. If you don't use them, you'll lose function.\\\"\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"29\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-29T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4682,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CQIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5lS\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/health/west-elm-caleb-dating-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"How not to be a 'West Elm Caleb': Entering and exiting dating app relationships gracefully\",\n                    \"article\": \" That is a West Elm Caleb. It all started out on TikTok, where women started sharing stories about a New York man named Caleb, who claimed to work as a furniture designer for the brand West Elm. Their stories -- accusations of ghosting, lovebombing and unsolicited explicit images -- painted him as someone who puts on an act for many women and then slips away without a word. CNN has reached out to West Elm to confirm he is a designer. The backlash has been focused on a specific Caleb, but the phrase has become a rallying cry for people to condemn those hurting them in a way that seems particular to those looking for love on dating apps. As Covid has people more isolated and reevaluating priorities, Frances Kelleher, a dating coach based in Ireland, said she sees more people looking more in earnest for someone who can be there for them \\\"when the chips are down,\\\" she said. \\\"People, I feel, now are even more sensitive because they are looking for that one person,\\\" Kelleher said. While this pandemic point in time can feel unique, the rules and manners for entering and exiting relationships are much the same as they have always been, said Kelleher and Shamyra Howard, a licensed clinical social worker and AASECT certified sex therapist. The shortened \\\"AASECT\\\" stands for American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists. They shared what you can do to avoid falling prey to -- or even becoming -- another version of West Elm Caleb. What do you want? Not having a goal in mind can be a roadblock to success, both Howard and Kelleher said. A concrete goal may mean wanting to date multiple people, wanting something casual, or looking for potential commitment. Knowing what you are looking for can help you identify when someone is treating you poorly or when you might not be treating someone else as you should be, they said. Being transparent about what you want -- once you have gotten to know that person enough to decide if you are interested -- gives both people the opportunity to make an informed choice about their next steps, Howard said. Not everyone you swipe right on will make it to that phase, Kelleher said, and it's OK to cut your losses early. It's like running into someone at a grocery, she added. If you just exchanged a \\\"hello, how are you?\\\" you wouldn't feel obligated to say goodbye before you left the store. But if you spent time together and shared some personal details, it's only right to follow up and let them know if you want to see them again or not. There are people on the other side of the screen The larger dating pool found on apps and websites, and the physical separation, can lead to people not treating others as well as they would in person, Kelleher said. \\\"People don't have to have manners because they're behind a screen,\\\" she said. When you meet someone through your community, there is a social obligation to treat that person well, Kelleher said. You could run into that person at the local bar or at a mutual friend's party, and your reputation is at stake if you ghost them. That risk might not be as high when you meet online, but manners and morality are still important. \\\"How would you like to be treated?\\\" Kelleher said. \\\"It's just a text. You can say 'you know, I didn't see the connection, but thank you so much for your time and all the best with your search.'\\\" Keep an eye out for performance \\\"Lovebombing\\\" and \\\"breadcrumbing\\\" are two phrases that mean two very different things but can have the same impact on people -- stringing them along for something that isn't genuine, Howard said. Lovebombing is when the amount of affection doesn't match the real attachment that has developed in a relationship. Are they trying to introduce you to their family, sending gifts or professing their love before they have gotten to know you? Those are red flags of lovebombing, Howard said. These grand romantic gestures can be an indication that the person is prioritizing performance over connection. It could be a red flag for controlling behavior in the future, Howard said. When this happens, just take a step back, Kelleher said. Don't encourage the over-the-top behavior and watch how graciously they respond to your setting boundaries, Howard said. To keep from getting ahead of yourself, Kelleher recommended not scrolling through their social media, which can make you feel like you know a person better than you actually do. Breadcrumbing usually involves keeping contact and perceived connection without the intention to take it further. If you get the sense a potential partner is breadcrumbing you, try to set a date to meet. If they decline twice, it may be time to move on, Howard said. Get off the app and into a date Dating apps are good for casting a wide net, but almost everyone can benefit from moving offline with a potential partner as soon as they feel safe and comfortable, Kelleher said. \\\"Attraction is created through engagement,\\\" she said. \\\"How do you move? How do you communicate with me? How do you give me eye contact? How do you touch me?\\\"  Trust people to cope with their own emotions One of the primary reasons people ghost others is not because they are horrible people, but because they are afraid of hurting another person, Howard said. \\\"People really, physically feel rejection,\\\" Howard said. \\\"For a lot of people, it's a safety measure for them, so they aren't feeling the pain that they are causing others.\\\" While you aren't responsible for other people's feelings, you are responsible for your actions, she added. \\\"Regardless of if their feelings are going to be hurt, you have to trust that they are capable of managing and handling their own feelings, especially when you are upfront and honest with them,\\\" Howard said.  Get your own closure People love closure, Kelleher said. But waiting for someone else to provide it can lead to more heartbreak. If someone is not showing up for you or treating you well, that can signal that it's time to go your separate ways, Kelleher said. \\\"The most important things we have is our energy and our time,\\\" Kelleher said. \\\"Don't waste your time on image and people that aren't 110%.\\\" Looking for love can be a difficult, disheartening process. If you are being accused of ghosting, lovebombing or breadcrumbing, it may be worthwhile to seek out a professional counselor or therapist who can help you work through why you may be doing that before getting back out in the dating world, Howard said.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"29\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-29T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 6460,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CgIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5lj\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/health/exercises-to-improve-balance-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Here's the way to exercise for better balance\",\n                    \"article\": \" Falls aren't just the leading cause of injury in adults age 65 and older but in almost all age groups in the United States. That's why being classified as a klutz isn't just a funny moniker; It can be dangerous. It's also something you can change by exercising your way to better balance and decreased risk of injury. One of the most important benefits of exercise is making you less susceptible to injury in your daily life. Improving your balance does that by reducing your odds of falling. Balance-training exercise may not be what you expect. It's not just about practicing standing on one leg. The best way to enhance balance and prevent falls, particularly as we age, is through a multifaceted approach, research has shown. A well-rounded exercise program helps you improve body awareness and move better with increased strength, stability and coordination — all of which promote better balance. Regardless of what style of exercise you perform, the ability to move and balance your body in any activity comes from the connection between your brain, nervous system and muscles. This is your mind-body connection. Mind and body communication is driven specifically by two aspects of your central nervous system: proprioception, also known as kinesthetic sense, and your vestibular system. Proprioceptors located in your joints and muscles inform your sense of movement, posture and the orientation of your limbs in space. The vestibular system, located in your inner ear, provides a sense of overall balance based on the movement of the head. There are health issues, like neuropathy (damage to the nervous system), that can hinder balance. If you're a chronic klutz, it's important to see your doctor to rule out any medical problems. Make sure to check with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Read on for ways to leverage multifaceted exercise strategies to improve your balance. 1. Start by testing your balance One-leg stand test: How long can you stand on one leg without excessive wobbling? To try it, stand on a flat, stable surface — like a hard floor rather than a thick carpet — and lift one foot a few inches off the floor, balancing your weight over your remaining standing leg. Try it on both sides. In the aging population, the inability to stand on one leg is not only linked to greater risk of falls but also to cognitive decline. Ideally, you should be able to stand on one leg for at least 20 seconds without excessive wobbling. You can regularly practice single-leg standing balance as part of your training. Also use this activity as a gauge for reassessing your balance ability as you consistently work through the exercise strategies below. 2. Enhance body awareness and control Body-weight exercises: Now, you're ready to focus on movements that challenge your strength, mobility and balance. Being aware of your body's position and being able to control your movement is an essential aspect of any type of body-weight exercise, whether you're doing standard push-ups, squats or yoga postures. Through practice, you can learn to master these common exercises and do entire workouts based on using only your body weight, like the 10-minute workout featured at the top of this article. Another important aspect of body awareness is having an understanding of where your weight is centered and being able to shift your center of mass to different areas of your body in various positions to stay balanced. For instance, in a lateral lunge to the right, you need to shift your center of mass into your hip, leg and core on the right. Then when you move into lunging left, you need to transfer your center of mass to the left. As you work through body-weight exercises in any modality, be it the exercises in the 10-minute body-weight workout or a yoga, Pilates or tai chi session, pay attention to how you shift your weight to establish better balance in each position or movement. 3. Increase stability Strength training and posture exercises: Having functional strength and postural control are key elements for maintaining balance. Using free weights is a great way to strength train. By adding weight to common movements, like squatting and single-leg hinging, you can work on stabilizing those movements with added strength and control. Posture is connected to balance because of its impact on your alignment and ability to center your weight. When you have a slumped posture with a forward head position, your center of mass is pulled forward with your head, throwing off your skeletal alignment and balance. Because prolonged sitting and less-than-optimal breathing mechanics both adversely impact posture, it's important to address both in order to improve your posture. You can accomplish that by incorporating these exercises to break up bouts of sitting throughout your day and practicing these breathing exercises that put your ribcage in an optimal position for better posture.  4. Improve coordination Walk with intention: We often forget that the simple act of walking takes a great deal of balance and coordination. To be reminded, just watch a child learning to walk. Gait, the movement pattern known as walking, is one of the most fundamental human movements, requiring coordination of alternating and reciprocal movements throughout your upper and lower body. While your right foot steps forward, your left foot stabilizes you, and, at the same time, your left arm swings forward and your right arm swings back. When you take your next step with your left foot, everything alternates.  How functionally we walk influences how well we navigate our lives and, as we observe with children learning to walk, how susceptible we are to falls. Too often, we inadvertently create improper walking patterns that can throw off our balance, so it's important to walk with intention so you can notice any problems with your walking and correct them before they become habitual. To learn some of the common walking problems and how to fix them, watch this video. Try taking at least a 10-minute walk several times per week while paying attention to the balance of weight and movement in your body. The World Health Organization recommends 150 minutes of exercise per week. By incorporating the strategies above to meet your weekly exercise target, you'll not only be increasing your fitness level and life span but also improving your balance and reducing your risk of injury from falling.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"28\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-28T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 6439,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CwIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5l2\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/health/routine-vaccinations-millions-missed/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Millions of routine vaccinations have been missed amid the Covid-19 pandemic\",\n                    \"article\": \" Long before the coronavirus, public health officials were concerned about low levels of routine vaccinations that are recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for adults and adolescents for diseases like flu and HPV. A sharp drop in uptake over the two years of the pandemic has cut into the progress that has been made. Adults and adolescents have missed more than 37 million routine vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis of insurance claims by Avalere, a health care consulting firm.  The firm compared monthly claims from January 2020 through June 2021 against baselines from 2019. On average, the analysis found, monthly claims were down 32% for adults and 36% for adolescents compared with 2019. Vaccinations ticked up briefly in March 2021 but otherwise consistently lagged behind 2019 levels in all markets. Along with flu and HPV, vaccinations tracked in the analysis included hepatitis, chickenpox and shingles, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), meningococcal, pneumococcal and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis). In the US Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2030 plan, one goal in development is to increase the share of adults who receive recommended age-appropriate vaccines. \\\"We were increasing coverage rates pretty consistently every year, and we wanted to do more,\\\" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. Improving vaccination coverage for flu and HPV are particularly of high priority, she said. Meningitis and Tdap are required by schools in most states, and coverage rates tend to be higher. But with flu and HPV, there's a \\\"lack of urgency,\\\" and coverage rates were among the lowest.  As with Covid-19 vaccines, experts say that recommendations from health care providers -- including primary care physicians, nurses and pharmacists -- are one of the most effective ways to boost vaccination rates in general. The CDC recently published an outline of strategies to increase adult vaccination rates that was drafted by members of the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit and that served as a call to action to health care providers. \\\"Their recommendation remains the number one reason why people get vaccinated,\\\" said Dr. L.J. Tan, summit co-chair, chief policy and partnerships officer for immunize.org, and former liaison to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee for the American Medical Association. And Tan says the drop in routine vaccinations will come with costs in the years to come. \\\"The biggest challenge here is an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases. We'll see outbreaks. We'll see surges of increased morbidity because of increased disease. And we'll see increased costs to the health care system,\\\" he said. \\\"When you couple it with Covid, we might see increased demand on the capacity of the health care system.\\\" Between January 2020 and June 2021, adolescents ages 7 to 18 missed a total of about 10 million routine vaccinations, and adults age 19 and older missed a total of about 27 million vaccinations since January 2020, according to the Avalere analysis. Overall, those insured by commercial insurance plans accounted for nearly two-thirds of missed doses. Experts stress the importance of getting up to date as soon as possible. \\\"Go get that vaccine that you're missing. Catch up on the series. Have you started something, but you haven't finished the series? Go finish it now. If you're due for something that you haven't even started, go get it now,\\\" Tan said. \\\"Now is the time to get caught back up again.\\\"  Getting a flu shot now can still make a difference in the current season, he said. And as Covid-19 continues to circulate at an extremely high level in the US, keeping up with other routine vaccinations can help ease stress in a time of uncertainty. \\\"Routine vaccinations should give peace of mind,\\\" Hannan said. \\\"We know these vaccines work.\\\" The analysis by Avalere -- and funded by GlaxoSmithKline -- used millions of de-identified patient records captured in a clearinghouse database. The datasets capture 42% of the US population insured by commercial plans, 69% of the Medicaid population, 25% of the Medicare Advantage population and less than 10% of Medicare Fee-For-Service claims nationwide.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"28\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-28T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4296,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"DAIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5mH\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/health/eco-anxiety-harmful-for-health-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Do you have 'eco-anxiety'? Here's how to find out\",\n                    \"article\": \" In her book, \\\"Taking the Heat: How Climate Change Is Affecting Your Mind, Body, and Spirit and What You Can Do About It,\\\" author and former CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider documents these challenges and shares experts' advice on how to cope.  Here, she offers insights about the impact of climate on health. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: How can climate change lead to health problems? Bonnie Schneider: Our environment affects the core drivers of health. Temperature changes, air and water quality, food safety and availability, and even our emotional well-being are tied up with our natural surroundings. Changes to these variables can impact both healthy people and those with preexisting conditions. Take temperature, for example. Ever tried to sleep in a hot room with no air conditioning? Rising temperatures can disrupt sleep and diminish mental clarity and memory, research has shown. A study of young, healthy college students showed that those who slept with no AC during a heat wave performed worse on cognitive tests the next day than those in rooms with artificial cooling.  Climate change has been linked to certain types of extreme weather events, including intensified floods, wildfires, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes that last longer and produce more rainfall. In 2021, 20 weather and climate disaster events in the US resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion each. Overall, natural disasters now happen more frequently, impacting more people. These can cause burns and smoke inhalation from wildfires, injuries from debris falling, and other kinds of harm. Mental health is impacted, too, whether as fallout from trauma, community loss or being displaced. Research shows these psychological consequences can last for years or even decades. Also important to mention is that natural disasters can affect mental health even among those who haven't been directly impacted. Upheaval in one's own community can, of course, prompt distress. But just seeing images of weather destruction on TV can trigger anxiety. That's the case even if the specific weather event is not actually linked to climate change. CNN: What is \\\"eco-anxiety\\\" and how pervasive is it? Schneider: Eco-anxiety refers to the anxiety and fear that people have over climate change and the future of the planet. Of people ages 16 to 25, 84% expressed at least moderate worry about climate change in a 2021 global survey of 10,000 people. More than 56% believed \\\"humanity is doomed\\\" and 45% said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning. Experts at the Climate Psychiatry Alliance and the Climate Psychology Alliance confirm the genuine struggles that individuals, especially young people, are having with this kind of anxiety. It can cause severe disruption in daily life, intrude upon people's thoughts and interfere with healthy sleep.  CNN: Do certain medical conditions make people more vulnerable to environmental changes? Schneider: Yes. Most medical experts say weather extremes of any kind can stress the body. With the climate changing, we're getting hotter days for a longer period of time. This can lead to troubles for people with certain autoimmune diseases that flare up under particular environmental conditions. Lupus, for example, can be triggered by bright sunlight due to UV ray exposure, according to the medical experts I interviewed. Some evidence suggests relationships between pain and relative humidity, pressure and wind speed. For those suffering from arthritis, more frequent powerful storms may mean more potential for pain. Yet other data negates these findings, such as the study that found no relation between rainfall and outpatient visits for joint or back pain. Still, these researchers concede the weather-pain correlation may exist and they urge additional study. CNN: What does climate change have to do with infectious disease? Schneider: The loss of biodiversity has become a huge problem. Even small, subtle shifts and disruptions to the natural habitats of wildlife affect humans. We're all part of the ecosystem. In a September 2020 paper written by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. David Morens, the two infectious disease specialists warn that pandemics are occurring more frequently. They call the Covid-19 pandemic \\\"yet another reminder that human activities represent aggressive, damaging, and unbalanced interactions with wildlife and will increasingly provoke new disease emergencies.\\\" Environmental shifts alter many types of vector-borne diseases. Lyme, for example. When temperatures rise, ticks become more of an issue at northern latitudes, which means we could start to see Lyme disease in places where people don't expect it. This could cause difficulties, given how challenging Lyme can be to diagnose. Mosquitoes bring additional concerns. More flooding increases their prevalence and the risk of them transmitting diseases. Then there is the waterborne flesh-eating bacteria. Rising water temperatures are believed to have brought deadly bacteria to previously unaffected waters. The Vibrio species, for example, can invade the body through any tiny opening in the skin, rapidly causing severe illness and even death. One 2018 study found that the yearly case counts of all Vibrio infections increased by 41% between 1996 and 2005. Swimming in coastal waters off Florida, Maryland and the Delaware Bay has led to numerous cases. CNN: What impact does global warming have on allergies? Schneider: Allergy season has gotten longer. More frost-free days mean more potentially irritating pollens. There's also a debate among scientists about whether increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has made pollen more intense. Molds are other allergens affected by weather, exacerbated by more frequent storms, intense flooding and damp days. Many asthma attacks are first triggered by allergies, too. Asthma can be triggered by thunderstorms and wildfire smoke. It's all connected. CNN: No wonder people are experiencing climate anxiety. What helps them cope? Schneider: Psychologists and psychiatrists I spoke with emphasized that we can't scoff at eco-anxiety. It's rooted in valid concerns, and people are genuinely troubled. Experts recommend finding a community of like-minded people by joining groups like the \\\"Climate Cafés\\\" organized by the Climate Psychology Alliance, where you can talk about difficult feelings in a safe space held by trained facilitators. Youth-specific organizations provide other opportunities to connect. For individual counseling, the Climate Psychiatry Alliance has a directory listing \\\"climate aware\\\" therapists. Taking actions, large and small, helps, too. Experts advise getting involved with climate justice activism or participating in something local like a beach cleanup. Mindfulness meditation and gratitude are other tools for addressing eco-anxiety. On my website, I give instructions for short, simple mindfulness practices. And I created a gratitude journal called \\\"One Week in Winter\\\" with writing prompts and exercises alongside weather facts.  When it comes to anxiety, nature has therapeutic effects for both adults and children. Gardening or doing something constructive outdoors — even during cold weather — can turn a sense of helplessness into agency. In \\\"Taking the Heat,\\\" I outline specific, age-based strategies for children and advice for adults. Spending time in nature is even healing, interestingly enough, for those who've suffered from trauma at the hands of the elements. Researchers have found that humans have an intrinsic desire to connect with the outdoors after a natural disaster. It's part of the coping process. For any of us, just 20 or 30 minutes walking or sitting in a place that connects us with nature can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. That decrease is good for mind and body alike.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"28\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-28T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 7894,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}"

Researchers looked at overdose data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2015 and 2019 to calculate the total number of years of life lost for 10- to 19-year-olds who died during that time. If the data is expanded to include people up to 24 years of age, unintentional drug overdoses resulted in the loss of 1.25 million years of life.  The number of young people dying from an unintentional overdose has steadily increased in recent years, as it has for the general population, according to data from the National Institutes of Health. Earlier studies have shown that mental health issues, unstable housing and other factors may be to blame for many of these unintentional drug overdoses. \\\"This is just completely unacceptable from a public health standpoint, because every one of these deaths is preventable,\\\" said study co-author Dr. Orman T. Hall, a psychiatry specialist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Hall believes the research also shows that public health interventions that are aimed at adults probably don't work as well for all ages. \\\"A lot of our public health interventions are geared towards adults. And we know that the types of messaging and, really, the points of contact for adolescents and young people are different from adults,\\\" Hall said. The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended universal screening for substance use with adolescent patients. If the adolescent has a positive screen for drugs, the association encourages pediatricians to find out whether substance use is interfering with the teen's daily activities or putting their safety at risk. Doctors are urged to talk to the teen about the dangers of drugs and the effects on the brain, as well as talk to their parents, and then refer them for treatment.  Often, though, that's where the system falls short, according to Dr. Paula Riggs, a professor and director of the Division of Addiction Science, Prevention and Treatment in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \\\"Less than 10% of kids go to treatment with the standard screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment model that we're using,\\\" said Riggs, who wasn't involved in the new study. \\\"They do a great job screening, but the referral to treatment part is not working. It's broken.\\\" Riggs says she's been thinking a lot about how to improve the system to get more kids into treatment so they don't overdose. As a clinician, as well as a researcher, she's seen an increasing number of children who need help for problems with opioids and fentanyl. \\\"There are systems barriers and silos, and the adultified models that we have are not so much appropriate and developmentally adapted\\\" for teens, Riggs said. For example, she recently got a call from a 16-year-old who was in the emergency room for fentanyl withdrawal.  \\\"He said, 'I don't want to leave. I was here two weeks ago with a fentanyl withdrawal, and they discharged me with a list of numbers to detox programs. I called them all, but they're all for adults. They won't take me.' He was afraid he would relapse -- or worse -- without the help,\\\" Riggs said. There are some effective evidence-based treatments for adolescents, studies show. A type of therapy called motivational enhancement can work. It helps people strengthen their motivation to quit using, build a plan for change and develop coping strategies for high-risk stuations. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also be helpful. Something as simple as a warmer handoff between the doctor and a treatment program works, Riggs says: Instead of handing a teen a list of numbers to call, the doctor will ask if they can share the teen's information with her, and she will reach out to the adolescent to have a brief confidential consultation. \\\"Giving a kid a list of numbers to call, you won't get them into treatment that way,\\\" Riggs said. She's getting about 40% to 40% of young patients to then engage in substance use treatment. And she's training more people on this method, but it takes time.  More doctors also need to be trained to work with patients with substance use problems, Riggs said. Studies show that even brief training sessions can boost a pediatrician's ability to help young patients. Riggs also said more people need to be trained and licensed to prescribe buprenorphine or other medication-assisted treatments. \\\"We're still in the middle of a raging and rising opioid epidemic in this country, and kids younger and younger are getting into it, and the fentanyl is just -- well, it's literally killing them,\\\" Riggs said. \\\"We need to get more kids into treatment.\\\"\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4791,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BAIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_pmv\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/physical-activity-monitors-increase-study-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"One easy way to get moving again, according to science\",\n                    \"article\": \" Monitoring exercise increased that activity among the more than 16,000 participants in a study published last week. Researchers looked at data from 121 randomized control trials and 141 study comparisons to find what impact exercise monitors -- like those found on phone apps and Fitbits -- had on everyday physical activity, moderate and vigorous physical activity, and sedentary time, according to the study. Using fitness apps increased everyday physical activity by an equivalent of 1,235 steps a day, and moderate and vigorous physical activity by 48.5 minutes a week, research showed. The impact on sedentary time was insignificant, according to the study. \\\"People who use activity monitors and wearables are more active than people that do not,\\\" said Rasmus Tolstrup Larsen, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen's department of public health. \\\"These effects are highly relevant in terms of health and risk of diseases, especially among people who are only moderately active or do not meet current guidelines for physical activity,\\\" he said via email. Larsen is also a management consultant at IQVIA Healthcare. The efficacy of fitness monitors has been a commonly investigated question since they hit the market, but this study takes the largest comprehensive look to date, Larsen said. And it comes as many people are looking to get moving again during a pandemic that has created conditions encouraging more sedentary behavior. \\\"In a post-covid time, the need for focus on behavioural change in relation to physical activity and inactivity is as urgent as ever before,\\\" Larsen said via email. \\\"Modern physical activity monitors (wearables, smart watches or fitness-trackers) have the potential to be used as facilitators for behavioural change, providing direct feedback on activity to the user.\\\" While the study is \\\"careful and useful,\\\" it does raise further questions, said Dr. David Asch, a professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine and Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Center for Health Care Innovation. He said he would have liked to see an analysis as well of how the different trials the study examined used rewards and incentives.  How to use them better If you are hoping 2022 will be a more active year than those that came before, Larsen recommended looking into a monitoring device -- or using the ones available on your smartphone. \\\"The devices are cheap, simple, and innovative. Now we can safely say that they are effectively motivating people for more activity in a safe way,\\\" Larsen added. But an activity monitor alone may not be your best bet for success, said Dr. Mitesh Patel, associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and vice president for clinical transformation at Ascension, a private health care system. \\\"Changing behavior is always hard,\\\" said Patel, who was not involved in the study. \\\"Using an activity monitor, like the ones available within smartphones and other devices, can be an important part of efforts to increase physical activity.\\\" Other research in the field suggests that they work even better when combined with programs aimed at changing behavior, like adding elements that make the behavior more like a game or leveraging financial or social incentives, Patel said. What these tracking apps do add is a level of personal accountability, said Dana Santas, a CNN fitness contributor and mind-body coach for professional athletes. It doesn't even have to be electronic, she added. Using a notebook or any physical reminder tends to embody our conscience. And a little competition with yourself never hurts, Santas said. \\\"When my Apple Watch sends me a message saying, 'you can still make it happen,' it motivates me to make whatever happen that my watch is telling me I haven't done yet, like reaching 10,000 steps or spending more time standing,\\\" Santas said. Making goals, adding incentives and adding in some accountability with a physical activity tracker may be what it takes to get you moving again, the experts agreed.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4070,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BQIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_pnE\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-approval/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine receives full FDA approval\",\n                    \"article\": \" The vaccine, named Spikevax, is now approved for use in people ages 18 and older. It is not approved or authorized for use in younger individuals. There's no difference between the approved vaccine and the vaccine previously available through emergency use authorization. Moderna's is the second Covid-19 vaccine to receive full approval from the FDA. Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, was approved for use in people age 16 and older in August. The Pfizer vaccine is also authorized for use in individuals ages 5 to 15. Moderna said the FDA based its decision to give full approval on scientific evidence shared by Moderna in its submission package to the agency, which included six month follow up data from a Phase 3 clinical trial study as well as FDA-required manufacturing and facilities data. \\\"This is a momentous milestone in Moderna's history as it is our first product to achieve licensure in the U.S.,\\\" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel  said in the release. \\\"The full licensure of Spikevax in the U.S. now joins that in Canada, Japan, the European Union, the UK, Israel, and other countries, where the adolescent indication is also approved. We are grateful to the U.S. FDA for their thorough review of our application. We are humbled by the role that Spikevax is playing to help end this pandemic.\\\" Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting commissioner, called the approval a \\\"significant step\\\" in the fight against Covid-19. \\\"The public can be assured that Spikevax meets the FDA's high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality required of any vaccine approved for use in the United States,\\\" Woodcock said in a statement. \\\"While hundreds of millions of doses of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine have been administered to individuals under emergency use authorization, we understand that for some individuals, FDA approval of this vaccine may instill additional confidence in making the decision to get vaccinated.\\\" The two-dose vaccine has been available in the US under FDA emergency use authorization since December 18, 2020. Since then, more than 204 million doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the US, accounting for about 38% of all doses administered, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 75 million people have completed their initial series with the Moderna vaccine, and about 38.5 million people have gotten a Moderna booster shot. Makers of Covid-19 vaccines originally applied for emergency use authorizations because the authorization process takes less time than what's required for full approval. Emergency use authorization is what its name suggests -- a medical product, such as a vaccine, that gets special FDA authorization to be used during an emergency. When the health emergency is over, \\\"then any EUA(s) issued based on that declaration will no longer remain in effect,\\\" according to the FDA. A booster dose of the vaccine at a 50mg dose is currently available under EUA for those 18 years and older. A third 100mg dose of the vaccine is authorized for use in immunocompromised adults.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 3098,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"BgIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5kY\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/health/moderna-mrna-hiv-vaccine/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"First patients vaccinated in clinical trial of HIV experimental vaccine that uses Moderna's mRNA technology\",\n                    \"article\": \" The trial, titled IAVI G002, is being conducted in partnership with IAVI, a nonprofit scientific research organization. It is testing a vaccine that delivers HIV-specific antigens to the body with the goal of inducing an immune response. These antigens were initially developed by researchers at IAVI and Scripps Research, led by Dr. William Schief. In a \\\"proof-of-concept\\\" trial last year, the research team found the HIV antigens produced the desired immune response in 97% of participants. The current trial builds on the previous one by testing the primary version of the vaccine and also a booster version, and by employing Moderna's mRNA technology, which was previously used to create a successful Covid-19 vaccine. \\\"We are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna's mRNA platform.

The new trial, funded in part by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will follow 56 HIV-negative adult participants, with the goal of studying both the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Forty-eight of the volunteers will receive at least one dose of the primary vaccine, 32 of which will also receive the booster. The remaining eight will receive the booster vaccine alone.

In the United Kingdom, people in England no longer have to show their Covid-19 vaccination passes to get into nightclubs and other large venues. Masks aren't required in any public places, although they remain recommended on public transport. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also easing their restrictions. But in the United States, \\\"we know there is still much to be done to stop the spread of COVID-19 and end the pandemic. We are still seeing far too many new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths,\\\" Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote in an email to CNN on Friday. The US daily average of cases is near 500,000, with more than 1,000 deaths, according to the CDC, which encourages everyone to get vaccinated and boosted if they're eligible. \\\"As we look forward to the spring, it's important to continue practicing prevention measures that we know work -- vaccinating, wearing a mask in public, indoor settings, staying home when you are sick, and washing your hands frequently,\\\" Nordlund wrote. Many US counties and cities rely on coronavirus transmission rates to determine when or if to ease restrictions and recommendations -- and nearly every single county is still experiencing high levels of spread. Community transmission is still key metric In the United States, most Covid-19 orders happen at the local level. And the CDC's data on coronavirus transmission by county is used as a key metric in decision-making around public health policies and when certain restrictions should be implemented or lifted, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday. The CDC tracks and measures the spread of the virus by county and presents its findings on a map using a four-tiered, color-coded system that shades in counties with \\\"high\\\" levels of transmission as red, those with \\\"substantial\\\" levels as orange, \\\"moderate\\\" levels as yellow and \\\"low\\\" levels as blue. \\\"This is really important,\\\" Freeman said of the data. \\\"It's based on new cases per 100,000 persons in the past seven days. Low is less than 10. Moderate is another range, substantial another and high is another,\\\" she said. \\\"And then a secondary indicator is percentage of positive (nucleic acid amplification) tests during the past seven days.\\\" The CDC defines low transmission of the coronavirus as a community having fewer than 10 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week and less than 5% test positivity during the past week. High transmission is at least 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week, and 10% or greater percentage of positive tests. As of Monday, nearly all counties are in the red, with high levels of transmission. Only four are identified as having low levels: Kalawao County, Hawaii; King County, Texas; Arthur County, Nebraska; and Terrell County, Texas. Glasscock County, Texas, is identified as having substantial transmission. \\\"The whole country is still red,\\\" Freeman said. \\\"So we haven't yet overcome this latest surge.\\\"  In Columbus, Ohio, the recommendation for the city's mask order is \\\"that we need to be in CDC's yellow category for moderate community transmission for four consecutive weeks\\\" before the order can be lifted, spokesperson Kelli Newman wrote to CNN in an email Friday. In North Carolina's Mecklenburg County, there is an indoor mask mandate in place that will automatically lift once the percent positivity rate for the county falls below 5% for seven consecutive days, Raynard Washington, the county's public health director, told CNN on Friday. \\\"Within that mandate, there's actually a stipulation that's tied to community transmission, at which once the community reaches a certain level of transmission, as measured by percent positivity, the mask mandate itself will automatically be rescinded,\\\" Washington said. He added that right now, the county is \\\"a bit away\\\" from reaching that low level. In San Francisco, city officials announced Thursday that even though Covid-19 cases are \\\"still high,\\\" they are \\\"dropping rapidly\\\" and beginning Tuesday, city office workers, gym members and some other groups of people may remove their masks indoors if they are \\\"up to date\\\" on their vaccinations. In Colorado, the state Department of Public Health and Environment on Friday removed the requirement that people must show proof of vaccination to attend unseated, public indoor events of more than 500 attendees in Arapahoe, Adams, Boulder, and Jefferson counties — as well as the City and County of Denver, and the City and County of Broomfield. Health officials in Colorado have told reporters that the statewide percent positivity remains high, but shows \\\"encouraging\\\" decreases. There is no definitive, blanket guidance from the CDC on when communities should lift certain Covid-19 policies and return to some version of normal. But NACCHO plans to hold brainstorming and listening sessions this spring with local and federal public health officers to discuss what the end of the pandemic might look like -- and how to determine when we've reached the end. \\\"NACCHO is having meetings coming up in the spring where we're really actively focused on these discussions, but we're hoping before then, we'll have a little bit more direction and guidance to go on,\\\" Freeman said, adding that the first meeting is scheduled for April. She expects representatives from the CDC, Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in attendance.  It is going to be a \\\"real challenge\\\" to determine a clear benchmark for when Covid-19 health measures should lift in the United States, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday. \\\"Right now, you look at a lot of federal health guidance and it says that these measures should be lifted when there's low prevalence,\\\" Gottlieb told CBS's Margaret Brennan on Face The Nation. \\\"That was the old measure. In the age of Omicron, with a much more contagious variant and with the fact that the population has a lot of immunity, so we're less susceptible overall, we may need to rethink that,\\\" Gottlieb said Sunday. \\\"We may need to decide that once we get to 20 cases per 100,000 per day that may be the point at which we start to withdraw these things,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm not so sure we're going to get to 10 anytime soon. Right now, Washington DC is at 15. New York's at 75. With this new Omicron strain that's circling we may stall out around 20 -- and that may be the point where we have to consider withdrawing a lot of these measures.\\\" 'We're in a better place now' As the United States marks two years since the first laboratory-confirmed case of Covid-19, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said last week he's feeling positive about the direction the nation is headed. \\\"I am more optimistic about the pandemic today than I have been since it was declared a pandemic nearly two years ago,\\\" Frieden, currently the CEO and president of a global health initiative called Resolve to Save Lives, told CNN on Wednesday. Frieden added that the \\\"flash flood\\\" of cases stemming from a surge of the Omicron variant should soon slow, largely as a result of effective vaccines. \\\"We don't know if there will be another wave, but we do know that we've got much stronger defenses than we've ever had,\\\" Frieden said. \\\"We're in much better shape than we've ever been. But we do need to hang on for just a few more weeks, until the Omicron flood recedes, so we don't overwhelm the hospitals, which are really stressed out.\\\" US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has said he shares Frieden's optimism that the nation is in better shape, but he urges Americans to remain vigilant against Covid-19. \\\"I certainly share the optimism that we're in a better place now, and we will be in a better place in a few weeks, but I don't think that means that we should take our foot off the accelerator,\\\" Murthy told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday, though he added that we shouldn't underestimate the coronavirus. \\\"What gives me more optimism and hope, Jake, is the fact that we not only have abundantly available vaccines -- we not only see that they're working well to protect people against hospitalization and death -- but we have more therapeutics,\\\" Murthy said. \\\"These together, along with a targeted use of tests and masks, this is what I believe is going to help us get through future waves, as well.\\\"\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"31\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-31T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 9153,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CAIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5lE\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/health/exercise-good-for-sexual-health-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Why exercise is also good for your sexual health\",\n                    \"article\": \" Forty-three percent of women and 31% of men have some form of sexual dysfunction, with obesity and a lack of exercise often being factors, according to the National Institutes of Health. A study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine found men with either a high waist circumference or elevated BMI were 50% more likely to have erectile dysfunction, while approximately half of obese women reported problems with sexual activity, desire and performance, at least some of the time, in a study published in Obesity.   Women who exercised up to six hours per week, in contrast, showed lower sexual distress and resistance in their clitoral arteries compared to women who did not exercise, according to a 2021 study published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. The exercisers also showed significantly higher levels of desire, arousal, lubrication and orgasm. \\\"This is truly a medical issue we should be dealing with as part of someone's overall health and well-being,\\\" said Dr. Karyn Eilber, a urologist at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a sexual wellness expert. \\\"But there's still a stigma around the topic.\\\"   There shouldn't be, said Eilber and other experts. Sex is a critical part of being human, and its significance is not just to procreate. Quality sexual activity has a major impact on your mental and emotional health, your quality of life and the strength of your intimate relationships. A series of studies backs this up, indicating sex and affectionate touch are critical for multiple aspects of well-being, such as feeling understood, cared for and accepted.    Here's what else happens to your body and mind when you exercise regularly. Important note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. Your circulation gets a boost All aerobic exercise increases your circulation, or blood flow, and helps ensure a healthy circulatory system. And a strong, smooth blood flow is key for arousal. In men, it aids in erections, and in women, it's instrumental in vaginal lubrication and clitoral sensation. Your endurance increases When you're working out regularly, you develop more endurance. That's important for your sexual health, because having sex is in itself a workout. The Mayo Clinic compares a bout of sexual intercourse to climbing two or three flights of stairs. And a study by the National Institutes of Health says a half-hour of sexual activity can burn 125 calories for men and nearly 100 for women, similar to walking at a 3 mile-per-hour pace.    You become more confidant Once you establish a routine exercise regimen, you feel fitter and leaner. This, in turn, improves self-esteem. \\\"Nothing is sexier than self-confidence,\\\" Eilber said. Indeed, a 2019 study published in the Journal of Personality found women had more romantic interest in men with higher social confidence, whether that confidence was innate or trained.   Your stress levels decrease Being stressed, anxious or depressed can dampen your libido. Depression in particular is often related to problems with sexual functioning, and the more severe the depression, the worse the problems, according to a 2018 study published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry. The study found this is especially true when it comes to sexual desire and satisfaction. Luckily, exercise is great at combating stress, anxiety and depression, which can translate into a revived sex drive. Antidepressants are also notorious for negatively affecting your libido, Eilber said, so if exercising can help you lower your dosage or scrap them altogether, all the better. Your overall health improves Adopt a regular exercise program, and your general health will improve. Working out may even help you stave off serious conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, which sometimes require medications that inhibit arousal. These two medical conditions also can damage the tiny arteries in the penis, resulting in erectile dysfunction. In fact, erectile dysfunction is often one of the first noticeable side effects of high blood pressure and diabetes.   How much exercise is necessary to improve your sexual health? It all depends on the person, so it's best to check with your physician. Experts say even short periods of exercise, such as regular brisk walks, can improve your sexual well-being. You do have to be careful not to overdo it, though. If you still aren't convinced it's time to grab your sneakers and start moving, consider this warning from Eilber. \\\"There is something to that phrase, 'Use it or lose it,'\\\" she said. \\\"Your pelvic organs are like any other body part. If you don't use them, you'll lose function.\\\"\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"29\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-29T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4682,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CQIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5lS\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/29/health/west-elm-caleb-dating-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"How not to be a 'West Elm Caleb': Entering and exiting dating app relationships gracefully\",\n                    \"article\": \" That is a West Elm Caleb. It all started out on TikTok, where women started sharing stories about a New York man named Caleb, who claimed to work as a furniture designer for the brand West Elm. Their stories -- accusations of ghosting, lovebombing and unsolicited explicit images -- painted him as someone who puts on an act for many women and then slips away without a word. CNN has reached out to West Elm to confirm he is a designer. The backlash has been focused on a specific Caleb, but the phrase has become a rallying cry for people to condemn those hurting them in a way that seems particular to those looking for love on dating apps. As Covid has people more isolated and reevaluating priorities, Frances Kelleher, a dating coach based in Ireland, said she sees more people looking more in earnest for someone who can be there for them \\\"when the chips are down,\\\" she said. \\\"People, I feel, now are even more sensitive because they are looking for that one person,\\\" Kelleher said. While this pandemic point in time can feel unique, the rules and manners for entering and exiting relationships are much the same as they have always been, said Kelleher and Shamyra Howard, a licensed clinical social worker and AASECT certified sex therapist. The shortened \\\"AASECT\\\" stands for American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists. They shared what you can do to avoid falling prey to -- or even becoming -- another version of West Elm Caleb. What do you want? Not having a goal in mind can be a roadblock to success, both Howard and Kelleher said. A concrete goal may mean wanting to date multiple people, wanting something casual, or looking for potential commitment. Knowing what you are looking for can help you identify when someone is treating you poorly or when you might not be treating someone else as you should be, they said. Being transparent about what you want -- once you have gotten to know that person enough to decide if you are interested -- gives both people the opportunity to make an informed choice about their next steps, Howard said. Not everyone you swipe right on will make it to that phase, Kelleher said, and it's OK to cut your losses early. It's like running into someone at a grocery, she added. If you just exchanged a \\\"hello, how are you?\\\" you wouldn't feel obligated to say goodbye before you left the store. But if you spent time together and shared some personal details, it's only right to follow up and let them know if you want to see them again or not. There are people on the other side of the screen The larger dating pool found on apps and websites, and the physical separation, can lead to people not treating others as well as they would in person, Kelleher said. \\\"People don't have to have manners because they're behind a screen,\\\" she said. When you meet someone through your community, there is a social obligation to treat that person well, Kelleher said. You could run into that person at the local bar or at a mutual friend's party, and your reputation is at stake if you ghost them. That risk might not be as high when you meet online, but manners and morality are still important. \\\"How would you like to be treated?\\\" Kelleher said. \\\"It's just a text. You can say 'you know, I didn't see the connection, but thank you so much for your time and all the best with your search.'\\\" Keep an eye out for performance \\\"Lovebombing\\\" and \\\"breadcrumbing\\\" are two phrases that mean two very different things but can have the same impact on people -- stringing them along for something that isn't genuine, Howard said. Lovebombing is when the amount of affection doesn't match the real attachment that has developed in a relationship. Are they trying to introduce you to their family, sending gifts or professing their love before they have gotten to know you? Those are red flags of lovebombing, Howard said. These grand romantic gestures can be an indication that the person is prioritizing performance over connection. It could be a red flag for controlling behavior in the future, Howard said. When this happens, just take a step back, Kelleher said. Don't encourage the over-the-top behavior and watch how graciously they respond to your setting boundaries, Howard said. To keep from getting ahead of yourself, Kelleher recommended not scrolling through their social media, which can make you feel like you know a person better than you actually do. Breadcrumbing usually involves keeping contact and perceived connection without the intention to take it further. If you get the sense a potential partner is breadcrumbing you, try to set a date to meet. If they decline twice, it may be time to move on, Howard said. Get off the app and into a date Dating apps are good for casting a wide net, but almost everyone can benefit from moving offline with a potential partner as soon as they feel safe and comfortable, Kelleher said. \\\"Attraction is created through engagement,\\\" she said. \\\"How do you move? How do you communicate with me? How do you give me eye contact? How do you touch me?\\\"  Trust people to cope with their own emotions One of the primary reasons people ghost others is not because they are horrible people, but because they are afraid of hurting another person, Howard said. \\\"People really, physically feel rejection,\\\" Howard said. \\\"For a lot of people, it's a safety measure for them, so they aren't feeling the pain that they are causing others.\\\" While you aren't responsible for other people's feelings, you are responsible for your actions, she added. \\\"Regardless of if their feelings are going to be hurt, you have to trust that they are capable of managing and handling their own feelings, especially when you are upfront and honest with them,\\\" Howard said.  Get your own closure People love closure, Kelleher said. But waiting for someone else to provide it can lead to more heartbreak. If someone is not showing up for you or treating you well, that can signal that it's time to go your separate ways, Kelleher said. \\\"The most important things we have is our energy and our time,\\\" Kelleher said. \\\"Don't waste your time on image and people that aren't 110%.\\\" Looking for love can be a difficult, disheartening process. If you are being accused of ghosting, lovebombing or breadcrumbing, it may be worthwhile to seek out a professional counselor or therapist who can help you work through why you may be doing that before getting back out in the dating world, Howard said.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"29\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-29T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 6460,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CgIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5lj\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/health/exercises-to-improve-balance-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Here's the way to exercise for better balance\",\n                    \"article\": \" Falls aren't just the leading cause of injury in adults age 65 and older but in almost all age groups in the United States. That's why being classified as a klutz isn't just a funny moniker; It can be dangerous. It's also something you can change by exercising your way to better balance and decreased risk of injury. One of the most important benefits of exercise is making you less susceptible to injury in your daily life. Improving your balance does that by reducing your odds of falling. Balance-training exercise may not be what you expect. It's not just about practicing standing on one leg. The best way to enhance balance and prevent falls, particularly as we age, is through a multifaceted approach, research has shown. A well-rounded exercise program helps you improve body awareness and move better with increased strength, stability and coordination — all of which promote better balance. Regardless of what style of exercise you perform, the ability to move and balance your body in any activity comes from the connection between your brain, nervous system and muscles. This is your mind-body connection. Mind and body communication is driven specifically by two aspects of your central nervous system: proprioception, also known as kinesthetic sense, and your vestibular system. Proprioceptors located in your joints and muscles inform your sense of movement, posture and the orientation of your limbs in space. The vestibular system, located in your inner ear, provides a sense of overall balance based on the movement of the head. There are health issues, like neuropathy (damage to the nervous system), that can hinder balance. If you're a chronic klutz, it's important to see your doctor to rule out any medical problems. Make sure to check with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Read on for ways to leverage multifaceted exercise strategies to improve your balance. 1. Start by testing your balance One-leg stand test: How long can you stand on one leg without excessive wobbling? To try it, stand on a flat, stable surface — like a hard floor rather than a thick carpet — and lift one foot a few inches off the floor, balancing your weight over your remaining standing leg. Try it on both sides. In the aging population, the inability to stand on one leg is not only linked to greater risk of falls but also to cognitive decline. Ideally, you should be able to stand on one leg for at least 20 seconds without excessive wobbling. You can regularly practice single-leg standing balance as part of your training. Also use this activity as a gauge for reassessing your balance ability as you consistently work through the exercise strategies below. 2. Enhance body awareness and control Body-weight exercises: Now, you're ready to focus on movements that challenge your strength, mobility and balance. Being aware of your body's position and being able to control your movement is an essential aspect of any type of body-weight exercise, whether you're doing standard push-ups, squats or yoga postures. Through practice, you can learn to master these common exercises and do entire workouts based on using only your body weight, like the 10-minute workout featured at the top of this article. Another important aspect of body awareness is having an understanding of where your weight is centered and being able to shift your center of mass to different areas of your body in various positions to stay balanced. For instance, in a lateral lunge to the right, you need to shift your center of mass into your hip, leg and core on the right. Then when you move into lunging left, you need to transfer your center of mass to the left. As you work through body-weight exercises in any modality, be it the exercises in the 10-minute body-weight workout or a yoga, Pilates or tai chi session, pay attention to how you shift your weight to establish better balance in each position or movement. 3. Increase stability Strength training and posture exercises: Having functional strength and postural control are key elements for maintaining balance. Using free weights is a great way to strength train. By adding weight to common movements, like squatting and single-leg hinging, you can work on stabilizing those movements with added strength and control. Posture is connected to balance because of its impact on your alignment and ability to center your weight. When you have a slumped posture with a forward head position, your center of mass is pulled forward with your head, throwing off your skeletal alignment and balance. Because prolonged sitting and less-than-optimal breathing mechanics both adversely impact posture, it's important to address both in order to improve your posture. You can accomplish that by incorporating these exercises to break up bouts of sitting throughout your day and practicing these breathing exercises that put your ribcage in an optimal position for better posture.  4. Improve coordination Walk with intention: We often forget that the simple act of walking takes a great deal of balance and coordination. To be reminded, just watch a child learning to walk. Gait, the movement pattern known as walking, is one of the most fundamental human movements, requiring coordination of alternating and reciprocal movements throughout your upper and lower body. While your right foot steps forward, your left foot stabilizes you, and, at the same time, your left arm swings forward and your right arm swings back. When you take your next step with your left foot, everything alternates.  How functionally we walk influences how well we navigate our lives and, as we observe with children learning to walk, how susceptible we are to falls. Too often, we inadvertently create improper walking patterns that can throw off our balance, so it's important to walk with intention so you can notice any problems with your walking and correct them before they become habitual. To learn some of the common walking problems and how to fix them, watch this video. Try taking at least a 10-minute walk several times per week while paying attention to the balance of weight and movement in your body. The World Health Organization recommends 150 minutes of exercise per week. By incorporating the strategies above to meet your weekly exercise target, you'll not only be increasing your fitness level and life span but also improving your balance and reducing your risk of injury from falling.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"28\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-28T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 6439,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"CwIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5l2\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/health/routine-vaccinations-millions-missed/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Millions of routine vaccinations have been missed amid the Covid-19 pandemic\",\n                    \"article\": \" Long before the coronavirus, public health officials were concerned about low levels of routine vaccinations that are recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for adults and adolescents for diseases like flu and HPV. A sharp drop in uptake over the two years of the pandemic has cut into the progress that has been made. Adults and adolescents have missed more than 37 million routine vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an analysis of insurance claims by Avalere, a health care consulting firm.  The firm compared monthly claims from January 2020 through June 2021 against baselines from 2019. On average, the analysis found, monthly claims were down 32% for adults and 36% for adolescents compared with 2019. Vaccinations ticked up briefly in March 2021 but otherwise consistently lagged behind 2019 levels in all markets. Along with flu and HPV, vaccinations tracked in the analysis included hepatitis, chickenpox and shingles, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), meningococcal, pneumococcal and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis). In the US Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2030 plan, one goal in development is to increase the share of adults who receive recommended age-appropriate vaccines. \\\"We were increasing coverage rates pretty consistently every year, and we wanted to do more,\\\" said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. Improving vaccination coverage for flu and HPV are particularly of high priority, she said. Meningitis and Tdap are required by schools in most states, and coverage rates tend to be higher. But with flu and HPV, there's a \\\"lack of urgency,\\\" and coverage rates were among the lowest.  As with Covid-19 vaccines, experts say that recommendations from health care providers -- including primary care physicians, nurses and pharmacists -- are one of the most effective ways to boost vaccination rates in general. The CDC recently published an outline of strategies to increase adult vaccination rates that was drafted by members of the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit and that served as a call to action to health care providers. \\\"Their recommendation remains the number one reason why people get vaccinated,\\\" said Dr. L.J. Tan, summit co-chair, chief policy and partnerships officer for immunize.org, and former liaison to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee for the American Medical Association. And Tan says the drop in routine vaccinations will come with costs in the years to come. \\\"The biggest challenge here is an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases. We'll see outbreaks. We'll see surges of increased morbidity because of increased disease. And we'll see increased costs to the health care system,\\\" he said. \\\"When you couple it with Covid, we might see increased demand on the capacity of the health care system.\\\" Between January 2020 and June 2021, adolescents ages 7 to 18 missed a total of about 10 million routine vaccinations, and adults age 19 and older missed a total of about 27 million vaccinations since January 2020, according to the Avalere analysis. Overall, those insured by commercial insurance plans accounted for nearly two-thirds of missed doses. Experts stress the importance of getting up to date as soon as possible. \\\"Go get that vaccine that you're missing. Catch up on the series. Have you started something, but you haven't finished the series? Go finish it now. If you're due for something that you haven't even started, go get it now,\\\" Tan said. \\\"Now is the time to get caught back up again.\\\"  Getting a flu shot now can still make a difference in the current season, he said. And as Covid-19 continues to circulate at an extremely high level in the US, keeping up with other routine vaccinations can help ease stress in a time of uncertainty. \\\"Routine vaccinations should give peace of mind,\\\" Hannan said. \\\"We know these vaccines work.\\\" The analysis by Avalere -- and funded by GlaxoSmithKline -- used millions of de-identified patient records captured in a clearinghouse database. The datasets capture 42% of the US population insured by commercial plans, 69% of the Medicaid population, 25% of the Medicare Advantage population and less than 10% of Medicare Fee-For-Service claims nationwide.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"28\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-28T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 4296,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"_index\": \"articles\",\n                \"_type\": \"_doc\",\n                \"_id\": \"DAIwnH8BbDZFpnQg_5mH\",\n                \"_score\": 1,\n                \"_ignored\": [\n                    \"article.keyword\"\n                ],\n                \"_source\": {\n                    \"type\": \"article\",\n                    \"publisher\": \"CNN\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/28/health/eco-anxiety-harmful-for-health-wellness/index.html\",\n                    \"title\": \"Do you have 'eco-anxiety'? Here's how to find out\",\n                    \"article\": \" In her book, \\\"Taking the Heat: How Climate Change Is Affecting Your Mind, Body, and Spirit and What You Can Do About It,\\\" author and former CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider documents these challenges and shares experts' advice on how to cope.  Here, she offers insights about the impact of climate on health. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: How can climate change lead to health problems? Bonnie Schneider: Our environment affects the core drivers of health. Temperature changes, air and water quality, food safety and availability, and even our emotional well-being are tied up with our natural surroundings. Changes to these variables can impact both healthy people and those with preexisting conditions. Take temperature, for example. Ever tried to sleep in a hot room with no air conditioning? Rising temperatures can disrupt sleep and diminish mental clarity and memory, research has shown. A study of young, healthy college students showed that those who slept with no AC during a heat wave performed worse on cognitive tests the next day than those in rooms with artificial cooling.  Climate change has been linked to certain types of extreme weather events, including intensified floods, wildfires, severe thunderstorms and hurricanes that last longer and produce more rainfall. In 2021, 20 weather and climate disaster events in the US resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion each. Overall, natural disasters now happen more frequently, impacting more people. These can cause burns and smoke inhalation from wildfires, injuries from debris falling, and other kinds of harm. Mental health is impacted, too, whether as fallout from trauma, community loss or being displaced. Research shows these psychological consequences can last for years or even decades. Also important to mention is that natural disasters can affect mental health even among those who haven't been directly impacted. Upheaval in one's own community can, of course, prompt distress. But just seeing images of weather destruction on TV can trigger anxiety. That's the case even if the specific weather event is not actually linked to climate change. CNN: What is \\\"eco-anxiety\\\" and how pervasive is it? Schneider: Eco-anxiety refers to the anxiety and fear that people have over climate change and the future of the planet. Of people ages 16 to 25, 84% expressed at least moderate worry about climate change in a 2021 global survey of 10,000 people. More than 56% believed \\\"humanity is doomed\\\" and 45% said their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily life and functioning. Experts at the Climate Psychiatry Alliance and the Climate Psychology Alliance confirm the genuine struggles that individuals, especially young people, are having with this kind of anxiety. It can cause severe disruption in daily life, intrude upon people's thoughts and interfere with healthy sleep.  CNN: Do certain medical conditions make people more vulnerable to environmental changes? Schneider: Yes. Most medical experts say weather extremes of any kind can stress the body. With the climate changing, we're getting hotter days for a longer period of time. This can lead to troubles for people with certain autoimmune diseases that flare up under particular environmental conditions. Lupus, for example, can be triggered by bright sunlight due to UV ray exposure, according to the medical experts I interviewed. Some evidence suggests relationships between pain and relative humidity, pressure and wind speed. For those suffering from arthritis, more frequent powerful storms may mean more potential for pain. Yet other data negates these findings, such as the study that found no relation between rainfall and outpatient visits for joint or back pain. Still, these researchers concede the weather-pain correlation may exist and they urge additional study. CNN: What does climate change have to do with infectious disease? Schneider: The loss of biodiversity has become a huge problem. Even small, subtle shifts and disruptions to the natural habitats of wildlife affect humans. We're all part of the ecosystem. In a September 2020 paper written by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. David Morens, the two infectious disease specialists warn that pandemics are occurring more frequently. They call the Covid-19 pandemic \\\"yet another reminder that human activities represent aggressive, damaging, and unbalanced interactions with wildlife and will increasingly provoke new disease emergencies.\\\" Environmental shifts alter many types of vector-borne diseases. Lyme, for example. When temperatures rise, ticks become more of an issue at northern latitudes, which means we could start to see Lyme disease in places where people don't expect it. This could cause difficulties, given how challenging Lyme can be to diagnose. Mosquitoes bring additional concerns. More flooding increases their prevalence and the risk of them transmitting diseases. Then there is the waterborne flesh-eating bacteria. Rising water temperatures are believed to have brought deadly bacteria to previously unaffected waters. The Vibrio species, for example, can invade the body through any tiny opening in the skin, rapidly causing severe illness and even death. One 2018 study found that the yearly case counts of all Vibrio infections increased by 41% between 1996 and 2005. Swimming in coastal waters off Florida, Maryland and the Delaware Bay has led to numerous cases. CNN: What impact does global warming have on allergies? Schneider: Allergy season has gotten longer. More frost-free days mean more potentially irritating pollens. There's also a debate among scientists about whether increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has made pollen more intense. Molds are other allergens affected by weather, exacerbated by more frequent storms, intense flooding and damp days. Many asthma attacks are first triggered by allergies, too. Asthma can be triggered by thunderstorms and wildfire smoke. It's all connected. CNN: No wonder people are experiencing climate anxiety. What helps them cope? Schneider: Psychologists and psychiatrists I spoke with emphasized that we can't scoff at eco-anxiety. It's rooted in valid concerns, and people are genuinely troubled. Experts recommend finding a community of like-minded people by joining groups like the \\\"Climate Cafés\\\" organized by the Climate Psychology Alliance, where you can talk about difficult feelings in a safe space held by trained facilitators. Youth-specific organizations provide other opportunities to connect. For individual counseling, the Climate Psychiatry Alliance has a directory listing \\\"climate aware\\\" therapists. Taking actions, large and small, helps, too. Experts advise getting involved with climate justice activism or participating in something local like a beach cleanup. Mindfulness meditation and gratitude are other tools for addressing eco-anxiety. On my website, I give instructions for short, simple mindfulness practices. And I created a gratitude journal called \\\"One Week in Winter\\\" with writing prompts and exercises alongside weather facts.  When it comes to anxiety, nature has therapeutic effects for both adults and children. Gardening or doing something constructive outdoors — even during cold weather — can turn a sense of helplessness into agency. In \\\"Taking the Heat,\\\" I outline specific, age-based strategies for children and advice for adults. Spending time in nature is even healing, interestingly enough, for those who've suffered from trauma at the hands of the elements. Researchers have found that humans have an intrinsic desire to connect with the outdoors after a natural disaster. It's part of the coping process. For any of us, just 20 or 30 minutes walking or sitting in a place that connects us with nature can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. That decrease is good for mind and body alike.\",\n                    \"bias\": 0,\n                    \"topic\": \"Health\",\n                    \"tags\": [\n                        \"Health\"\n                    ],\n                    \"year\": \"2022\",\n                    \"month\": \"01\",\n                    \"day\": \"28\",\n                    \"creation_date\": \"2022-01-28T00:00:00\",\n                    \"character_length\": 7894,\n                    \"comments\": null,\n                    \"added_by\": \"Anurag\",\n                    \"added_on\": \"2022-03-18T08:41:09.055043\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}"
